## Security Best Practices for Users

When using Ino Icon Maker:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**

   ```bash
   npm update ino-icon-maker
   ```

2. **Use Official Sources Only**

   - Install from npm: `npm install ino-icon-maker`
   - Clone from official GitHub: `https://github.com/narek589/ino-icon-maker`

3. **Verify Package Integrity**

   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

4. **Input Validation**

   - Only process images from trusted sources
   - Be cautious with user-uploaded files in production

5. **File System Permissions**

   - Ensure output directories have appropriate permissions
   - Don't run with elevated privileges unless necessary

6. **Network Security** (when using HTTP API)
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Rate limit API endpoints
   - Validate file uploads

## Known Security Considerations

### Image Processing

This package uses [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) for image processing. Sharp handles various image formats and has its own security considerations:

- We use Sharp's built-in validation
- Large images are automatically handled
- Malformed images are rejected

### File System Operations

- Input validation is performed on all file paths
- Temporary files are cleaned up after processing
- Output paths are sanitized

### HTTP API (Optional)

If you use the built-in HTTP API:

- It's intended for development/internal use
- Add authentication before exposing to the internet
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all inputs

## Security Updates

Subscribe to security updates:

- Watch the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/narek589/ino-icon-maker)
- Follow npm package updates
- Check [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for security-related releases

## Disclosure Policy

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions as soon as possible
5. Publish a security advisory on GitHub
